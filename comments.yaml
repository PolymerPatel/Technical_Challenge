Libraries required:
    - geopandas
    - rasterio
    - shapely
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - fiona (dependency of geopandas)

    # Lines 20 to 23 are core system libraries for file system operations
    # libraries gpd and rasterio handle geospatial data (vector and rasters)
    # Specific mapping method from shapely.geometry provides geometric operations and conversions

    Section 2: getting data from file paths

    The missing elements 

    #Does None need to be changed to geoJSON?
    Line 52: Use the function Path from pathlib to make sure it works across platforms
    Line 105: # understanding of extracting metadata was a knowledge gap
              # vector and raster data differences require two functions
    Line 119 to 122: # understand geometry types dictionary and why it is required
                     # attributes column to inform users about available data attributes

    Line 133: # Open the raster
    Line 137: # Validate band index
    Line 142: # Read the vector file
    Line 144: # Conditional statement logic checking if the vector has polygons
    Line 150: # Understand the need to reproject the vector to match raster CRS
    Line 156: # Understand how GeoDataFrame function can check for empty intersection within bounds and crs
    Line 166: # Understand geoms variable to get geometries for masking
              # Mask the raster with the polygon geometries
    Line 173: # Extract valid pixels (not nodata) from the specified band 
              # Convert to 0-based indexing
    Line 177: # Handle potential nodata values
    Line 181: # If no nodata value defined, use all pixels
    Line 205: # Get raster file path
